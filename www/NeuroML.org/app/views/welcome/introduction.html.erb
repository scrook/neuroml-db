The NeuroML project focuses on the development of an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/default.asp">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a> based description language
that provides a common data format for defining and exchanging descriptions of neuronal cell and network models.
The current approach in the project uses <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/schema/default.asp">XML schemas</a> to define the model specifications.
</p>
<p>
The current scope of NeuroML focuses on models which are based on the biophysical and anatomical properties of real neurons, i.e. which include
details of the detailed neuronal morphologies, the membrane conductances which underly action potential generation
(<a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Conductance-based_models">conductance based models</a>), and which are based on known
anatomical connectivity.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, the NeuroML model description language is being developed in Levels, where each Level concentrates on a particular biophysical scale. <p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="50%">

<table id="longlist" style="border:1px solid black;">
    <tr>
        <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;"><a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Level1">Level 1</a> focuses on the anatomical aspects of cells and consists of a schema for
            <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Metadata">Metadata</a> and the main
<a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=MorphML">MorphML</a> schema.
<br/>
<br/>
This Level is most suitable for tools (such as <a href="tool_support#NeuronLand">NeuronLand</a>) which focus solely on detailed neuronal morphologies.
Note that the <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Metadata">Metadata</a> elements are used at this and higher Levels.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td style="border-bottom:1px solid black;"><a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Level2">Level 2</a> adds the ability to include information about the biophysical properties
of cells using the <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Biophysics">Biophysics</a> schema and also includes the properties of channel and
synaptic mechanisms using <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=ChannelML">ChannelML</a>.
<br/>
<br/>
This Level of model description is useful for applications (such as <a href="tool_support#NEURON">NEURON</a> and <a href="tool_support#MOOSE">MOOSE</a>) which
can be used to simulate neuronal spiking behaviour.

            <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Level3">Level 3</a> adds the ability to specify cell placement and network connectivity 
            using <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=NetworkML">NetworkML</a>.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Files containing positions and synaptic connections in <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=NetworkML">NetworkML</a> can be used
            by applications (such as <a href="tool_support#CX3D">CX3D</a> and <a href="tool_support#PCSIM">PCSIM</a>) to exchange details on (generated) network structure. Full
            <a href ="/NeuroMLValidator/Latest.jsp?spec=Level3">Level 3</a> files containing cell structure and 3D connectivity can be used by applications such as
            <a href="tool_support#neuroConstruct">neuroConstruct</a> for building and analysing complex network of biophysically detailed neurons.

<p>
The modular nature of the specifications makes them easier to develop, understand, and use
since one can focus on one module at a time; however, the modules are designed to fit together
seamlessly.</p>

<p>
Current schemas and more readable formats for the schemas are available
on the <a href="/specifications">specifications</a> page. 
One of the best ways to gain a better understanding of the structure of the standards is to view
the XML source for <a href="/NeuroMLValidator/Samples.jsp">examples</a> of 
specific models.</p>

<p>A paper describing the latest stable version of NeuroML has recently been
published in PLoS Computational Biology: <b>NeuroML: A Language for Describing Data Driven Models of Neurons and
Networks with a High Degree of Biological Detail, P Gleeson, S Crook, RC Cannon, ML Hines, GO Billings, M Farinella, TM Morse, AP Davison,
S Ray, US Bhalla, SR Barnes, YD Dimitrova,
RA Silver</b>. It can be downloaded <a
 href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1000815">here</a> and it describes in detail the structure of version 1.x (Levels 1-3,
MorphML, ChannelML, NetworkML), includes a detailed discussion of the elements
present at each level along with example NeuroML code (see the <a href="http://www.ploscompbiol.org/article/fetchSingleRepresentation.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000815.s001">supporting text</a>
of the paper), outlines current simulator support,
and presents a number of new cell and network models which have recently been
converted to the format.</p>

to simulate models from NeuroML documents, visit our 
<a href="tool_support">tools</a> page and 
view <a href="projects">related projects</a> to see how NeuroML can be
used with existing simulation platforms.</p>


<p>NeuroML version 2.0 is in active development.
See <a href="neuromlv2">here</a> for details on the ongoing work towards this new version of the language.</p>
