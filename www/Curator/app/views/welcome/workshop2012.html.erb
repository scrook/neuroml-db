						<h2>Convergence in Computational Neuroscience 2012
<p>Joint BrainScaleS CodeJam/NeuroML workshop, Edinburgh, 12-16th March</p></h2>


<p>The <a href="meetings.php">NeuroML Development Workshops</a> and the <a href="http://brainscales.kip.uni-heidelberg.de/">BrainScaleS</a> (previously FACETS) 
    <a href="http://neuralensemble.org/meetings.html">CodeJams</a> have been two important initiatives in recent years for developers of tools in computational
    and systems neuroscience to present their latest work, exchange ideas and work at achieving interoperability between software applications for investigating
    brain function. This year these groups held a joint workshop (<b>Convergence in Computational Neuroscience</b>) on March 12th-16th in the Informatics Forum in Edinburgh, UK.</p>


<p>The meeting was held at the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/informatics/about/forum/">Informatics Forum</a> in Edinburgh, UK, from 12th to 16th March 2012.




<h2>Meeting report</h2>

                (including the recently added <a href="tool_support#neuromorpho">NeuroMorpho.org</a> and <a href="tool_support#neuromorpho">Channelpedia</a>).<br/><br/>
                The requirements for v2.0 were presented. Explicit definitions of model component behaviour allows description of the dynamics of model components
                in a simulator independent, machine readable way. The relationship between LEMS and NeuroML2 was discussed.
                A short overview of NeuroML 2.0 was given including dimensions/units. Example of adaptive exponential integrate and cell network was presented.
                An overview of libNeuroML was given. Export to NEURON, neuroConstruct, interaction with SBML was shown. <br/>&nbsp;</i></td><td valign="top"> <b>Padraig Gleeson</b></td></tr>

                The INCF <a href="http://www.incf.org/programs/modeling">Task Force in Multiscale Modelling</a> created the language, consisting of an Abstraction Layer and User Layer.
                Mike's presentation focused on the abstraction layer which contains many terms for the object model.
                Core object in the Abstraction layer were presented: ComponentClass, Interface with Parameters, Ports (AnalogPorts, EventPorts and Reduce Ports),
                Dynamics with StateVariables and a Regime Transition Graph (with Transitions, StateAssignments, Aliases).<br/><br/>
                libNineML (in Python) loads and saves models from/to XML to/from Python that helps with code generation, turns models into NEST, NEURON and PyNN.<br/>&nbsp;</i>

            Different communities favour different types of models that are more suited for their domain.
            Current standardisation efforts depend on the initial people, individual funding structure, IP issues.
            Specifications, API's, test-suites, etc. really need industry-grade support which is not compatible with standard academic usages and possibilities.<br/><br/>
            The vision of COMBINE is to pave the space of model descriptions with coordination of standard development (without interference with the development).
            There are criteria for inclusion in the core COMBINE standards: new standards must be different from those already included, described in technical specification documents, free,
            open, developed and used by more than one team, democratically elected members, mature software support including API, and must be actively developed.<br/><br/>
            COMBINE organises joint meetings replacing standards specific ones (e.g. SBML Hackathon). Next COMBINE meeting is in Toronto in August. HARMONY for
            hacking will be in Maastricht in May.<br/>&nbsp;</i>

            <br/><br/><i>Sean presented the motivation for, current structure and the aims of the <a href="http://www.incf.org">INCF</a>. The goal of neuroscience is to understand
                the brain. We're at a crisis point in understanding disorders. Big Pharma is pulling out of neuroscience due to the high cost and risk of understanding these disorders.
                Past centuries have focused on obtaining observations. More recently, models were used to understand these observations. Today we have eScience as a new way of handling
                large-scale data, modelling, simulations, linking data, etc. One of the INCF's goals is to transform neuroscience into an eScience from level of molecules to clinic. <br/><br/>
                Integration of databases is a goal, which requires standardized data formats. There are 16 member countries in INCF. He gave an introduction to the 4 programs from the
                past few years: <a href="http://www.incf.org/programs/atlasing" >Digital
	Brain Atlasing</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.incf.org/programs/modeling" >Multi-Scale Modeling</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.incf.org/programs/pons">Ontologies of Neural Structures

            It will be based on a version control repository (initially Mercurial) storing the model files. It will have automatic generation of online documentation of the models
            from ChannelML, MorphML, etc. Connectivity matrices for network connections, etc. can be generated for models which are stored in neuroConstruct format.

                It is still not clear how some things should be done, in particular how to handle dimensions and units. Currently, dimensions are defined and then assertions about
                relationships among dimensions can be made. Units are not defined until NeuroML is written (with numerical values, e.g. -70mV).  There was some discussion of how dimensions
                should be defined. Physicists solved this problem by developing SI units. Both space and no space between values and units are allowed in LEMS.

<tr><td valign="top"><b>14:20</b></td><td>Experiences with using NeuroML 2
            <br/><br/><i>Avrama gave a brief report of her hands on experience with using NeuroML 2. 
                She has a medium spiny projection neuron model which she's translating to GENESIS. She didn't want to use a GUI unless absolutely necessary
                and has been manually editing the XML. Many of the (non calcium dependent) channels have
                already been converted to NeuroML 2. She can only run single compartment versions of her model since LEMS doesn't yet support multi compartmental models.
                She has produced some some multi segment morphologies in NML2, even though these can't be used in LEMS based simulations yet.
                She requires a way to specify distance from the soma. Another difficulty is not being able to define a template (dendritic) subbranch and add it multiple times to the cell.
                She will add spines later.
Calcium dependent channels are a work in progress in NeuroML v2.0, but some useful simulations have already been done with her developing model.<br/>&nbsp;</i></td><td valign="top"> <b>Avrama Blackwell</b></td></tr>

                Solinas S, Nieus T and D`Angelo E (2010) A realistic large-scale model of the cerebellum granular layer predicts circuit spatio-temporal filtering properties.

There were improvements made to the model in 2011 and it was translated to Python Neuron for parallel simulation on cluster. Added gap junctions, more realistic inputs.
Python eased improvements to the model. <br/><br/>
Points to address: It was very difficult to construct exclusion rules for the complex structure of the network.
This was difficult in both NEURON and Python. There must be a procedure for constructing the network since one must look for inhibition first then decide on a connection.
Also, for data visualisation, for voltage in space and time for the entire network, it would be useful to have a standard way to do this (also for field potentials).

                method to reduce model and see what the LFP looks like (and compared to Linden data). Then since it looked pretty good he created a network of these reduced
                models for simulation and analysis. Then looked at results from Utah array in Matlab. Next he'll add Gaussian connectivity and some patches and long range connections.<br/>&nbsp;</i></td><td valign="top"> <b>Richard Tomsett</b></td></tr>

            <br/><br/><i>James presented his work on the Neural Tissue Simulator, much of which was contained in the recent publication:
                Kozloski J and Wagner J (2011) An ultrascalable solution to large-scale neural tissue simulation. Frontiers in Neuroinformatics. 5:15.
                (<a href="http://www.frontiersin.org/neuroinformatics/10.3389/fninf.2011.00015/abstract">link</a>).<br/><br/>

                The key goals of this work are: to develop a simulator capable of testing mappings to various machine architectures, both parallel and multithreaded;
                to develop support for high level, abstract model definitions and simulation specifications; and to create an extensible simulator, able to map arbitrary,
                domain level models directly to a variety of data arrangements and computational implementations.<br/><br/>
                James discussed the process of defining the model (using the Model Definition & Graph Specification Languages), how the model elements are partitioned on the
                computing resources, and how these elements communicate during simulation to solve the model equations. He discussed the specific case of simulating cortical
                columns when synapses were determined through contact detection algorithms. He also presented some results for how the simulator scales for larger networks.
                The Neural Tissue Simulator is not currently publicly available, but James is keen to make it available, and to build a community of users. NeuroML support is
                also planned.

                somatosensory cortical column. Based on a database of anatomical reconstructions, electrophysiology, etc. they will fill the cortical column with cells based
                on known location, probability distributions.  Morphologies for those classes of cells are taken from library of cells called a collage with some rules about
                how they fit in based on constraints from reconstructions. Some of these cells have been "repaired" due to axon cuts in reconstructions.<br/><br/>
                Functional circuits are also based on biological data.
                Electrical behaviors are based on classifications based on firing patterns observed in experiments.
                This is combinatorial since each morphological class has a number of possible firing patterns. They use genetic algorithm to adjust parameters which are set
                up based on what is known (gene expression, etc). Channelome project uses cell culture and automated patch clamp by robot and then automated model fitting
                for data that are then posted to <a href="http://channelpedia.epfl.ch/">Channelpedia</a>. Channels there are available in ChannelML.
                Synaptic parameterization and validation for functional synapses are also based on database of recorded synaptic properties.<br/><br/>
                In silico model is compared to in vitro using same protocols as experiments. There was a standards and interoperability discussion:
                they are mostly using custom formats other than what they use with NEURON. Eilif welcomed greater support for more widely used standards.

                how they display info including images and related queries and such. Some place for community comments. Another goal is to expose
                high quality linked data with example of an open linked data graph.<br/>&nbsp;</i>

            <br/><br/><i>Sarah gave a brief overview of <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML">libSBML</a> and
                <a href="http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications">SBML Level 3</a>. libSBML, which provides an API for creating, editing and saving SBML in many languages
                (e.g. C++, Python, Java, Ruby, Perl) has been instrumental in the growth of the number of <a href="http://sbml.org/SBML_Software_Guide">applications supporting SBML</a>.
                <br/><br/>
                SBML Level 3 has a modular architecture, featuring a core specification (roughly in line with previous SBML releases) and a number of 
                <a href="http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki">specialist packages</a>,
                which applications can choose to support or not. Examples of these packages incluse <b>layout</b> for storing the spatial topology of a model's network diagram,
                <b>comp</b> for defining how a model is composed from other models and <b>spatial</b> for describing models that involve a spatial component. libSBML already has a generic
                framework to support extensions for generic packages.
