      <h3>Protocols</h3>
      <p>The dropdown contains the list of protocols to which the model was subjected. Select one from the drop down to see the model's response.</p>
      <h3>Stimuli</h3>
      <p>Some protocols have multiple stimuli (e.g. voltage levels held or current amplitudes injected). If so, a "Stimulus" slider will be visible when a protocol with multiple stimuli is selected.
        When visible, drag the slider left/right to see the model's
        response to a specific protocol stimulus. By default, the traces of all protocol stimuli are shown superimposed, each trace indicated by a different color.</p>
      <h3>Meta-Protocols</h3>
      <p>Some models will have additional meta-protocol parameters (e.g. different calcium concentration levels, random noise seeds). If available, use the second slider to see the
        effect of changing the meta-protocol parameter on the model response. When both sliders are visible, their values can be changed independently.</p>
      <h3>Trace detail</h3>
      <p>Using the mouse, hover near a point on a trace to see a popup with the point details. Top value shows the time. The bottom left value shows the name of the protocol stimulus,
        and the bottom right value shows the value of the plotted variable (e.g. voltage or current)</p>
      <h3>Zoom</h3>
      <p>The plots can be zoomed in/out to see plot details. On the right side of the plot, use the [+] and [-] buttons to zoom in/out on the center of the plot.</p>
      <h3>Pan</h3>
      <p>Once zoomed, the plots can be panned by dragging the mouse or swiping fingers sideways.</p>
      <h3>Reset Plot</h3>
      <p>Once a zoom/pan position is set, it will be maintained when the stimulus/meta-protocol parameter is changed. To reset the zoom/pan,
        click the circular arrow button below the zoom out button. Plot zoom will also be reset when the protocol is changed.</p>

      <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>Models were subjected to a benchmark current injection protocol (see Electrophysiology tab, Time Step Sensitivity protocol) using
        various fixed time step sizes.</p>
      <p>The resulting membrane potential was compared, at 1 ms intervals, to the membrane potential obtained using
        the smallest time step (1/1024 ms). For each time-step size, mean percent error difference and run time were measured.</p>
      <p>The error and run time were normalized and their sums computed for each time step size. The time-step size where the sum was the lowest
        was chosen as the optimal time-step.</p>
