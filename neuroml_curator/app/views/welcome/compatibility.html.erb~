<h1>Compatability with other MLs: SBML, CellML, NineML & mappings to simulators</h1>

    <p>There are a number of other modelling language initiatives which have overlapping aims to NeuroML. One of the goals of NeuroML 2 is to
        avoid the temptation to be "one modelling language to build them all", but to acknowledge that these other languages exist with active communities,
        there are large model repositories of <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels-main/">SBML</a> & <a href="http://models.cellml.org/cellml">CellML</a> models and corresponding
        tools available, and that many researchers will want to use these as
        components in computational neuroscience simulations with the minimum of effort.</p>


    <a name="SBML"/>
    <h3>SBML</h3>
    <p>There is a preliminary <a href="http://www.sbml.org">SBML</a> export function from libNeuroML which
        generates an SBML file containing the model as defined in LEMS/NeuroML 2 <b>Components</b>/<b>ComponentType</b>s. Try downloading libNeuroML
        and running: </p><p class="code">ant testSBML</p>

        <p>This export function requires more work, particularly related to the unit handling,
        but see <a href="lems/neuroml2.html#Ex9">here</a> for a working example.</p>

    <p>It should be possible to import a large class of SBML models into the LEMS framework to allow seamless use of SBML model elements beside NeuroML 2 elements for any simulator which understands
        LEMS. This is a work in progress using <a href="http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML">JSBML</a>. To test this try: </p><p class="code">ant testSBMLRead</p>


    <h3>CellML</h3>
    <p>Similar export/import options should be possible for <a href="http://www.CellML.org">CellML</a> as SBML. Work is also in progress towards this.</p>

    <a name="NineML"/>
    <h3>NineML</h3>

    <p><a href="http://www.nineml.org">NineML</a> is being developed as part of the <a href="http://www.incf.org/core/programs/modeling">INCF Multiscale Modelling Program</a>, and 
        developments in LEMS and NeuroML 2 have benefitted from discussions within that forum. </p>

    <p>libNeuroML can export files containing the equivalent NineML Abstraction Layer & User Layer entities (component/node/network)
        for a model read in in LEMS (with ComponentType, Component, network, etc.). A limited number of LEMS examples can be exported in this format, try downloading the application
        and running: </p><p class="code">ant testNineML</p> <p>This export will be updated as the NineML language evolves.</p>


    <table id="highlighted" align="center" >
        <tr><td>ComponentType was the original name for ComponentClass/ComponentType in LEMS.
                ComponentClass was adopted by both LEMS & NineML in early 2010, as an object with similar scope was being used in the NineML Abstraction Layer.
                However, as there are no current plans to incorporate key features of LEMS such as extension or composition of ComponentTypes into NineML, and so the LEMS
                element has been renamed ComponentType, to distinguish it.<br/><br/>

            These differences and future work towards greater compatibility between these formats will be discussed at the <a href="workshop2012.php">fourth NeuroML Development Workshop</a>. </td></tr></table>
            <a name="NEURON">&nbsp;</a>
    <h3>NEURON</h3>
    <p>There is a basic export function implemented for many LEMS based abstract cell models to <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/">NEURON</a>. Try downloading the application
        and running: </p><p class="code">ant testNEURON</p>

    <p align="center"><i>This shows 3 adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire model cells which have been specified in NeuroML 2 and run with the
            libNeuroML (left plots). The NEURON export function uses the LEMS <b>ComponentType</b> definition to generate NMODL files for the cell behaviour and NEURON Python files
            to execute the network (right plots). See <a href="lems/neuroml2.html#Ex8">here</a> for more details.</i></p>

    <h2>Object model for 3D hierarchical network generation</h2>


    <p>A package has been developed for prototyping ideas about specification of <a href="NeuroMLValidator/Networks.jsp">hierarchical network structures</a> in NeuroML 2.</p>

    <p align="center"><a name="nCnet" href="NeuroMLValidator/Networks.jsp">
            <img alt="Hierarchical network" src="http:///NeuroMLValidator/images/Netv2.png" align="middle" width="500"/></a>
    </p>
    <p align="center"><i>A network containing a 3x3 grid, each element of which is a subnetwork of 3 populations (2 laid out on regular 3D grids,
            and one randomly placed in a rectangular box above the others)</i>

    <p>A <a href="NeuroMLValidator/Networks.jsp#JavaAPI">Java package</a> has been produced which can generate network descriptions in this form. The NeuroML 2
        files produced are valid according to the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/neuroml/browser/NeuroML2/Schemas/NeuroML2/NeuroML_v2alpha.xsd">
            NeuroML v2alpha Schema</a> mentioned above.</p>

    <p>This package does not yet interact with LEMS, but it is planned to harmonise the network descriptions used here with those LEMS uses to create networks</p>



    <h2>What's missing?</h2>
    <p>A summary of the holes & areas of current work in the current specifications...</p>
    <ul class="bluebullets">
        <li><b>Network connection templates:</b> more advanced options for defining connectivity between populations of cells is required.
            This is being worked on in LEMS and for NineML.</li>

        <li><b>Support for multi compartment modelling in LEMS:</b> While the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/neuroml/browser/NeuroML2/Schemas/NeuroML2/NeuroML_v2alpha.xsd">
                NeuroML v2alpha Schema</a> supports description of multi compartmental conductance based neuronal models, the LEMS interpreter can only execute single compartment cell models at present.</li>
        
        <li><b>Better numerical integration in LEMS:</b> At present the LEMS interpreter uses a simple forward Euler numerical integration method, limiting the size and speed of simulations.</li>
