BatchNeuroML.py creates a series of SQL statements that, when executed on the MySQL server, will insert the models specified in a CSV file into the database.

Input: A CSV file, formatted according to the format specified in 'Documentation/CSV Column Description.xlsx' file, and specified by the value of the 'model_csv_file' variable at the top of the BatchNeuroML.py file. The CSV files are typically generated by a script in one of the ../Sources folders.

Output: Two files: batch_insert_statements.sql and cp_statements.sh, which contain the SQL statements + shell copy statements needed to insert the models into the database and copy their .nml files to the webserver, respectively.
